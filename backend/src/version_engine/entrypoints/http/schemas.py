"""
Version Engine — Data models

All data types used by the PuppyOne platform layer:
1. Tree API request/response schemas
2. Commit history, diff, and rollback schemas

Identity model:
    Commits are identified by a 40-hex SHA-1 commit_id — the SHA-1
    over the git ``commit`` object body produced by ``encode_commit``
    (tree + parent + author/committer lines + message). On disk the
    commit body is stored as a zlib-compressed loose object whose
    SHA-1 is exactly this commit_id, so PuppyOne and any standard git
    tool agree byte-for-byte.
    The old integer `version` columns / fields are gone.
    Clients that need to represent "no prior state" send an
    empty string "" as the base_commit_id.
