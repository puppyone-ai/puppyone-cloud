"""
VersionRepoManager — per-project version repository factory

Each PuppyOne project corresponds to one logical version repository, composed of:
  - ObjectStore (S3StorageBackend)  -> content storage
  - HistoryManager (Supabase)       -> version history
  - AuditLog (Supabase)             -> audit logs

Provides three repo views:
  - ProjectRepo       -> used by VersionAdminService (admin/history operations)
  - PuppyOneServerRepo -> used by the Write Engine
  - HostClientHandle  -> long-lived in-process version client per (project, scope),
                         bundled with a per-key lock that serialises pushes
                         against the same scope. Cached so the tree-index
                         walk only happens on first access; later pushes reuse
                         the cached path-to-blob index, mirroring how a
                         long-lived Git working copy keeps local object state
                         between commits.

        the *same* scope may both build an index; the second's work is then
        discarded. That's wasted CPU, not a deadlock.
