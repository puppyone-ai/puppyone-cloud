    Python heap twice and risked OOM under concurrent clones (GAP-1/14).

    on-disk spool (``request_path``) and pipe stdout to the client in
    chunks — neither the request nor the response is ever fully
    materialised in memory.

    generator deletes it once the pack has been sent (or the transfer is
    aborted). If this function RAISES before returning the response, the
    caller still owns ``request_path`` and must clean it up.
