"""
InProcessVersionClient — L4 **batch** adapter (in-process).

This module is the ``adapters/batch/`` entry from the architecture doc's
L4 lineup ("Product / AP / batch adapter"). "Batch" here means
"connector / sync job / MCP tool / sandbox" callers that live inside
the API process and need the same scope enforcement, conflict policy,
and audit logging as external ``git push`` traffic — but without the
HTTP round trip. The clone/modify/publish loop is modeled after Git
push so callers can reason about a single contract regardless of
whether they're a real Git client or an in-process consumer.

Usage:
    client = InProcessVersionClient(
        repo_manager, project_id, projection, actor="agent:example"
    )
    files = client.clone()           # full-content read path: {rel_path: bytes}
    client.push({"foo.md": b"new"}, deleted=["old.md"])
