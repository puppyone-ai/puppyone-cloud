"""
ProductOperationAdapter — Product Operation Adapter for typed Git-tree operations.

All channels (Web UI / Agent / Sandbox / MCP / Datasource / Ingest /
Table / Seed) submit product file actions through this class. The public
contract is typed product operations over the Write Engine.

Architecture:
    Each typed write op (``write_file``, ``delete``, ``mkdir``, ``move``,
    ``bulk_write``) constructs an O(D) tree splice via
    ``services.tree_splice`` and routes it through the Git-native transaction
    engine. Product/Web/API writes are project-root transactions by default.
    Access Point and Git adapters pass an explicit scope when they need a
    scoped repo facade. No host-client index bootstrap, no Git transport materialization,
    no full blob downloads, no protocol-handler publish path.

    Read ops resolve straight against the persisted Merkle root via
    ``VersionTreeReader`` (S3-cached tree-node reads only, no flattening).

    External protocol clients submit version intents through adapters.
    Product operations do not own publish semantics directly.

Usage:
    ops = ProductOperationAdapter(repo_manager)
    result = await ops.write_file("proj_1", "readme.md", b"# Hi", who="user:123")
    content = ops.read_file("proj_1", "readme.md")

    Carries enough metadata to record a commit (hash for the tree

    The ``hash`` MUST identify a blob that's already present in the
    project's ``ObjectStore`` — i.e. some upstream stage step has
    already written it (or confirmed it exists). Producing a
    ``BlobRef`` IS the contract: "I have already put bytes such that
    ``store.get(hash) == those bytes``." Anyone holding a
    ``BlobRef`` can safely commit it without re-uploading.

    Why a dataclass and not a tuple: ``size`` is purely informational
    today (tree nodes only store ``hash``), but we surface it in
    audit logs (``"uploaded N files (X bytes)"``), and future tree
    formats may inline size for fast directory listing. The named

    # The byte-taking ``write_file`` / ``bulk_write`` above are
    # convenience wrappers for "I have raw bytes in process memory".
    # They internally stage each blob (write to ObjectStore by hash)
    # and then commit by reference. The methods below expose those
    # two phases separately for callers that staged elsewhere — most
    # importantly, the multipart-upload path where blobs are
    # materialized in S3 directly and we never want them in the
    # Python process.
    #
    # Public surface for upload-pipeline callers:
    #   ``stage_blob_from_bytes(content)`` — returns a ``BlobRef`` after
    #     a single ``ObjectStore.put`` call. Same as what
    #     ``write_file`` does internally.
    #   ``bulk_write_refs(file_refs)`` — commit a tree update referencing
    #     already-staged blobs by hash. ``verify_blobs=True`` (default)
    #     does a HEAD round-trip per blob as a safety net against
    #     dangling commits — turn it off in known-good batches if the
    #     extra latency matters.
    #
    # The upload path (browser multipart, future CLI binary push) uses
    # ``stage_blob_from_s3`` (in ``ingest/file/jobs/jobs.py`` —
    # different module, S3-aware) to ``CopyObject`` from the upload
    # key into the version object key without touching the bytes, and
    # then calls ``bulk_write_refs`` here.

    async def stage_blob_from_bytes(
        self,

        content: bytes,

        """Write ``content`` to the project's version object store and
        return a ``BlobRef`` pointing at it.

        The store call is content-addressed and idempotent: writing
        the same bytes twice computes the same hash and is a no-op
        on the second call (so caller-side dedup is unnecessary —
        re-uploading the same file is free).

        Use this when you genuinely have bytes in memory (CLI text
        writes, connector outputs, internal templates). For multipart
        uploads where the bytes already live in S3, use
        ``ingest.file.jobs.jobs.stage_blob_from_s3`` instead — it
        uses S3 ``CopyObject`` to put the blob at the canonical object key without
        ever loading it into the backend process.

        Implementation note: we deliberately bypass the Write Engine
        here. A pure stage doesn't change any tree, so the scope
        lock + ``scope_hash`` DB read that a write transaction does
        upfront would be wasted work. Instead we go straight to the
        ObjectStore — exactly what the write path does internally for
        the blob-write step.

        in the same transaction (e.g. CLI ``/push`` after
        ``async_put_many``) and wants to skip the HEAD latency on a

        Compared to ``bulk_write(files: dict[str, bytes])``: this

        never enter the Python process. For a 100-file folder
        upload at typical web-PDF sizes, that's the difference
        between holding ~500 MB in RAM (and ~5 seconds of S3
        re-download) and holding zero.
