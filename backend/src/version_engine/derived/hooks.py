"""
Post-commit hooks — keep ``repository_scopes`` consistent with tree mutations.

When files/folders are deleted or moved in a PuppyOne project, scopes
that referenced those paths need to follow the change (rename) or get
surfaced as orphaned (delete). Both hooks are best-effort: failures
log and don't propagate.

Also provides ``push_and_finalize`` for in-process agent/sandbox working
copies that need a clone/edit/write-back lifecycle.
