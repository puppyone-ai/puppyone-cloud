"""
PuppyOneAuthenticator — version access authentication adapter

Maps PuppyOne's authentication system to the version access context:
  - JWT Bearer → human ProjectGrant + Project root view bounded by role
  - Access Key → connection + restricted repo scope

Supports:
  - Key revocation (revoked access points are rejected)
  - User identity binding via X-PuppyOne-User header
  - Channel pause enforcement via X-Puppy-Client header (cli):
    when present, the resolved scope's connector for that channel is
    consulted and the request is rejected with 403 if status='paused'.
