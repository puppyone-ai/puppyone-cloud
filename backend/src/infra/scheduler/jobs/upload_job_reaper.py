"""Scheduled recovery for stale upload jobs.

Upload finalize runs inline in the API request (not on a worker), so an
`upload_jobs` row only stays `running` forever if the API process died
mid-finalize. A legitimate finalize cannot outlast the HTTP request, so a
`running` row older than the stale window (set well above any request lifetime)
is a dead-process orphan we fail so it stops looking active.
