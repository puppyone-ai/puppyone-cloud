"""The single application coordinator for publishing a Project.

Every production creation path enters through this module.  The database
transaction first creates an unpublished Project plus its creator grant and a
durable operation.  The existing L5 ``VersionWriteEngine`` then installs the
canonical root.  Only the completion transaction changes the Project to
``ready``.

Contentful workflows use ``deferred`` publication: their callback runs while
the Project is still invisible, and any reported failure creates a durable
object-cleanup job before removing the unpublished database aggregate.  An
uncertain/crashed request remains hidden and is eventually aborted by the
initialization reconciler.
